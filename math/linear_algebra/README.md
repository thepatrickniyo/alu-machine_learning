- What is a slice?
- How do you slice a vector/matrix?
- What are element-wise operations?
- How do you concatenate vectors/matrices?
- What is the dot product?
- What is matrix multiplication?

# Requirements

## Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS** using **Python 3.5**
- Your files will be executed with **numpy (version 1.15)**
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/env python3

	•	A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
	•	Your code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.5)
	•	All your modules should have documentation:

python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'


	•	All your classes should have documentation:

python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'


	•	All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation:

python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'


	•	Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
	•	All your files must be executable
	•	The length of your files will be tested using wc

More Info

Installing Ubuntu 16.04 and Python 3.5

Follow the instructions listed in Using Vagrant on your personal computer, with the caveat that you should be using ubuntu/xenial64 instead of ubuntu/trusty64.

Python 3.5 comes pre-installed on Ubuntu 16.04. You can confirm this with:

python3 -V

Installing pip 19.1

wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
sudo python3 get-pip.py
rm get-pip.py

To check that pip has been successfully installed:

pip -V

Expected output:

pip 19.1.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/pip (python 3.5)

Installing numpy 1.15, scipy 1.3, and pycodestyle 2.5

pip install --user numpy==1.15
pip install --user scipy==1.3
pip install --user pycodestyle==2.5

To verify installation:

pip list
